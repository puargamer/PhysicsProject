A simple adventure game by Ivan Kwok based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Entrance, LivingRoom, Kitchen, and Bedroom
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Beginning and Ending
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: arrows(). Allows for a set of 3 interactive arrows to be used in an AdventureScene, each leading to a different door and runs doorlogic().
    - Enhancement 2: doorlogic(). A method that contains a door cinematic. The door 'opens' and leads to another location if the player has the right item in their inventory.

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: Entrance, LivingRoom, Kitchen, and Bedroom
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: There is at least a key and an arrow leading to a door in all scenes. 
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: Keys and doors describe themselves on mouse hover.
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: Keys and chests disappear on equip/use. Doors zoom in on entrance.
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: The 2 final keys spin around.
