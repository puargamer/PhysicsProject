A simple adventure game by Ivan Kwok based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Experience requirements:
- **The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player**
    - Player character moves the character using arrow keys. They control the ball by making contact with it and watching it richochet around. 
- **The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact).**
    - You must use the physics engine to put the ball into the goal. It can bounce around the screen and enemy players! Enemies push you back. 
- **3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).**
    - There are 3 increasingly difficult levels with different enemy placements. 
- **Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes**
    - There are 2 rest scenes and 1 final victory scene.
